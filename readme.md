To run pong:

* download the love framework, at least version 0.10.2 - https://love2d.org/#download
* clone the repo or download the zip and extract it
* For Linux: navigate to that directory and run `love Pong.love`
* on Windows you can do the equivalent in cmd, or you can also click and drag Pong.love to love.exe or a shortcut to love.exe
